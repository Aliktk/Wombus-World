# **Candidate Score Prediction: Regression Model Analysis**

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting candidate scores using regression models based on various features such as:

```bash

    `wombus_id`,
    `birth_continent`,
    `gender`,
    `age`,
    `college_degree`,
    `problem_solving_skill`,
    `technology_skill`,
    `english_skill`,
    `most_recent_income`,
    `total_jobs`,
    `shirt_color_preference`,
    `customer_exp_preference`,
    `work_env_preference`,
    `personal_growth_preference`,
    `honest_communication_preference`,
    `community_service_preference`,
    `remote_work_preference`,
    `industry_preferencescore`,

```

The goal is to evaluate multiple regression algorithms and find the best model to accurately predict candidate performance scores. We‚Äôll also save the model for future use.

## Model Deployment Method:

# Deployment Strategy for Wombus World Predictive Model

## Overview

Deploying the predictive model for estimating the scores of Wombi candidates requires a robust architecture capable of handling high traffic, given the expected volume of over 1 million applications per day. The deployment plan encompasses Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, model testing, monitoring, data storage, load balancing, and performance optimization.

## 1. CI/CD Pipeline

- Automate the deployment process.
- Ensure seamless integration of new code changes.

- **Version Control:** Use Git for source code management, ensuring that all changes are tracked and documented.
- **CI/CD Tools:** Leverage tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment processes.
- **Automated Testing:** Implement unit tests and integration tests to validate the model's functionality and performance metrics before deployment.

## 2. Model Testing

- Ensure the model performs as expected in the production environment.

- **Pre-Deployment Testing:** Conduct thorough testing using validation datasets to check for overfitting and to ensure generalizability.
- **A/B Testing:** Roll out the new model alongside the existing one for a subset of users, comparing performance metrics in real-time.

## 3. Monitoring

- Continuously track the model's performance post-deployment.

- **Performance Metrics:** Monitor key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R¬≤ to detect any degradation in performance.
- **Logging:** Use logging frameworks to capture detailed logs for tracking predictions and errors. Tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) can be implemented for log analysis.

## 4. Data Storage

- Efficiently manage the data for both model training and inference.

- **Data Storage Solutions:** Use cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage for storing historical candidate data and model artifacts.
- **Database Management:** Utilize databases like PostgreSQL or MongoDB for structured storage of candidate profiles and scores, ensuring fast retrieval and scalability.

## 5. Load Balancing

- Ensure that the application can handle high traffic without performance degradation.

- **Load Balancer:** Deploy a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancing) to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of the application, ensuring no single instance becomes a bottleneck.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Implement auto-scaling policies to dynamically adjust the number of instances based on traffic demand, optimizing resource usage.

## 6. Performance Optimization

- Minimize latency and maximize throughput.

- **Model Optimization:** Consider techniques such as model pruning and quantization to reduce the model size and inference time.
- **Caching:** Use caching strategies for frequently accessed data to speed up response times, utilizing Redis or Memcached.

## Conclusion

By following this deployment strategy, the Wombus World predictive model can be effectively integrated into the existing infrastructure, ensuring reliability and scalability to meet the anticipated demand. Continuous monitoring and optimization will be crucial in maintaining model performance and providing a seamless experience for users.
